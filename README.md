# etch-a-sketch

Project to try and replicate an etch-a-sketch toy.

I know that I did not commit very often for this project; I was too in the flow and completed the entire project in one go and really quickly. The lesson learnt from this project is that I need to start committing often, even if it is just completing a small part of the project.
