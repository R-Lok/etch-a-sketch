# etch-a-sketch
Project to try and replicate an etch-a-sketch toy.

I know that I did not commit very often for this project; I was too in the flow and completed the entire project in one go and really quickly. The lesson learnt from this project is that I need to start committing even if it is just getting one functionality working.
